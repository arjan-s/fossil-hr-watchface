# fossil-hr-watchface

## Introduction
The Fossil Hybrid HR watches have dynamic (free-form) watchfaces since firmware version DN1.0.2.20r.v1 (official app 4.6.0). These watchfaces are built in [JerryScript 2.1.0](https://jerryscript.net/) and packed together with assets and configurations into one file.

[Gadgetbridge](http://gadgetbridge.org/) (0.59.0 and up) uses the open source code from this repository to support these dynamic watchfaces. Due to licensing of Fossil's code, the official watchfaces cannot be redistributed. Hence the need for an open source watchface.

**Note:** this open source watchface is only supported by Gadgetbridge, not by the official Fossil app.

## Credits
- Daniel Dakhno, for his [app SDK](https://github.com/dakhnod/Fossil-HR-SDK), which has provided tools and information necessary to analyze and build watchfaces.
- [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) for providing an awesome repository of free icons.

## Building the watchface
First make sure you have the binaries `jerryscript` and `jerryscript-snapshot` available, version 2.1.0 (other versions will **not** work). Also, clone the [app SDK](https://github.com/dakhnod/Fossil-HR-SDK), because some of the provided tools are needed.

Pre-process your watchface with a tool like Gimp to 240x240 pixels and 2 bit (4 colors) grayscale. Then use the following command to convert your image to the RAW format used by watchfaces.

    python ../Fossil-HR-SDK/tools/image_compress.py -i watchface.png -o build/files/icons/background.raw -w 240 -h 240 -f raw

The same tool can be used to convert icons to the watch's format. Make sure you start with a **white** icon with transparent background. Then use the following command to convert your icon to the RLE format used by watchfaces.

    python ../Fossil-HR-SDK/tools/image_compress.py -i icon.png -o build/files/icons/icon.rle -w 24 -h 24 -f rle

Then, run the following commands in the checked out repository:

    mkdir -p build/files/code/
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' open_source_watchface.js -o build/files/code/openSourceWatchface
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_date.js -o build/files/code/widgetDate
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_weather.js -o build/files/code/widgetWeather
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_steps.js -o build/files/code/widgetSteps
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_hr.js -o build/files/code/widgetHR
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_battery.js -o build/files/code/widgetBattery
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_calories.js -o build/files/code/widgetCalories
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_2nd_tz.js -o build/files/code/widget2ndTZ
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_activemins.js -o build/files/code/widgetActiveMins
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_chanceofrain.js -o build/files/code/widgetChanceOfRain
    jerry-snapshot generate -f '' widget_custom.js -o build/files/code/widgetCustom
    python ../Fossil-HR-SDK/tools/pack.py -i build -o open_source_watchface.wapp

## Installing the watchface
**Option 1:**

1. Open Gadgetbridge
2. Tap on the "app manager" icon in the connected Fossil HR device card
3. Tap on the round "+" button at the bottom right
4. Select the .wapp file
5. Enjoy the watchface on your watch!

**Option 2:**

1. Share the .wapp file from another app with Gadgetbridge's "Firmware/Apps installer"
2. Click "Install"
3. Enjoy the watchface on your watch!

## Ideas for future exploration
- [ ] Timed backgrounds
- [ ] Navigation instructions on watchface or widget (from OsmAnd)
- [ ] Multiple configs (thus, watchfaces) switchable with physical button

## Bonus
Use `reversed_watchface.js` with background image `reversed_watchface.raw` for a fully reversed analog clock! Even the hands are running in reverse! No worries: notifications and menus are still displayed correctly.
